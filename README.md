## AUTH SERVICE

**Register METHOD:**
This METHOD allows a user to register by providing their email address. Upon registration, an OTP code is generated and sent to the user's email address for verification.

**Login METHOD:**
This METHOD allows a registered user to login using their email and password. Upon successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and returned to the client for authentication in subsequent requests.

**Forgot Password METHOD:**
This METHOD allows a user to reset their password if they have forgotten it. The user is able to enter their email address, and an OTP code is generated and sent to their email. If the code is valid, the user is able to set a new password.

**Change Password METHOD:**
This METHOD allows a logged-in user to change their password. The user is able to enter their current password and the new password they want to set.

**Logout METHOD:**
This METHOD allows a logged-in user to log out by invalidating their JWT token.

## OTP METHOD

**Generate OTP METHOD:**
This METHOD will be responsible for generating an OTP and saving it to the database along with the associated user.

**Verify OTP METHOD:**
This METHOD will be responsible for verifying that the OTP entered by the user is correct and has not expired. If the OTP is correct and not expired, it will mark the OTP as used.

**Expire OTP METHOD:**
This METHOD will be responsible for expiring an OTP that has not been used within the specified time limit.

**Resend OTP METHOD:**
This METHOD will be responsible for resending an OTP to the user in case they did not receive it or need to generate a new one.
